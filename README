Requires jQuery 1.2.6 included in the page. 

The delicious-top-user.js plugin is meant to be used for blogs and particularly forums. It was built for use at http://erlanguid.com but can be easily employed anywhere. 

Use: 

1. Add the delicious-top-user.js to the head of your page.
2. Add a div element to your page where you want the links to be displayed, with the class "delicious-user-top-links" and id "<delicious username>|<at least one tag>".
3. Optionally you can add a title div as a child element, and a link within that to toggle the visibility of all the links. just make sure that the link has an onlick=DeliciousUserTop.ToggleLinkVisibility(this) and the class "a.show-delicious-user-top". You can see an example at erlanguid.com or the blog link at the bottom of the readme.
Thats it! If you have any problems message me, and rememeber you can use multiple tags by stringing them like "<uname>|<tag1>+<tag2>", BUT it will only return the intersection of the links with each tag.

** You can see a more indepth explanation of the functionality at http://nickelcode.com/2008/12/06/delicious-user-top-javascript/.
