Requires jQuery 1.2.6 included in the page. 

The delicious-top-user.js plugin is meant to be used for blogs and particularly forums. It was built for use at http://erlanguid.com but can be easily employed anywhere. 

Use: 

1. Add the delicious-top-user.js to the head of your page.
2. Add a div element to your page where you want the links to be displayed, with the class "delicious-user-top-links" and id "<delicious username>|<at least one tag>".

Thats it! If you have any problems message me, and rememeber you can use multiple tags by stringing them like "<uname>|<tag1>+<tag2>", BUT it will only return the intersection of the links with each tag.

You can see a more indepth explanation of the functionality at http://nickelcode.com/2008/12/06/delicious-user-top-javascript/.
